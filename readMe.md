## Principle

Three pillars of efficient html and css

1.  Responsive Design

- Fluid Layouts
- Responsive & flexible images
- Media Queries
- Correct Units
- Desktop first vs Mobile first

2.  Maintainable and scalable code

- clean
- Easy-to-understand
- supports future growth
- resuable
- css architecture to organize files
- naming convention: BEM
- structured HTML

3.  Web Performance

- less HTTP requests
- DRY code
- compress code
- Use CSS preprocessors
- Less image & compressed image whenever necessary

## Concepts used:

1. COMPONENT-DRIVEN DESIGN

- components are building blocks that we use to build our interfaces.
- Modular Building Blocks that make up interfaces held together by layout of page.
- Re-usuable across intra and inter projects.
- Independent, allowing us to use them anywhere on the page.

2.  BEM - Block Element modifier
    eg:
    block{}
    block**element{}
    block**element--modifier{}

        Block: Stand alone component that is meaningful on it's own.

        Element: Part of a block that has no standalone meaning.

        Modifier: A flag that we can put on a block or element in order to make         them different from regular block or an element.

3.  7-1 pattern
    It is CSS architect to create logical folder or file structure introduced by Hugo Grauod for our CSS where :

- 7 different folders for partial sass files (or less depending on size and scope of project)
- 1 main Sass file to import all other files into a compiled css stylesheet.

The 7 folders:
i. base/
for basic product definations
ii. components/
one file for each component
iii. layout/
for Overall layout of project
iv. pages/
for styles for specific pages of the project
v. themes/
for different visual themes
vi. abstracts/
for codes that doesn't output any css such as variables and mixins
vii. vendors/
for third party css

## Concepts

advance CSS functionalities
propper way to use commomly used css functioanlities
css animation and really handy css animations
pseudo classes:
:link - use in the links
how css works behind the scenes i.e how CSS is processed in browser
building custom grid
Advanced Selectors

## RESPONSIVE DESIGN

Making website acessible for every user across any device platform.

### Mobile first vs Desktop first and Breakpoints

In _desktop first_ approach we optimize our website for large screen, and later we only write media queries to shrink the designs to fit the smaller screens. We can achieve this by writing media query test for _max-width_.

In case of _Mobile-first_ appraoch we start with witing CSS for mobile devices: small screens then using media query to expand design to large desktop screen. We can achieve this by writing media query test for _min-width_. This approach forces us developers to reduce websites and apps to the absolute essentials strpping away from unecessary contents in order to end up with a smaller and faster product.
